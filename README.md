This GitHub project addresses the need for early diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AFib), the most common sustained heart arrhythmia. The project introduces a robust time-frequency pattern analysis approach for automated AFib detection, utilizing smartphone-derived seismocardiography (SCG) and gyrocardiography (GCG) signals. The diagnostic performance of a smartphone mechanocardiogram (MCG) is evaluated through joint SCG-GCG recordings from 435 subjects, encompassing 190 AFib and 245 sinus rhythm cases. A fully automated AFib detection algorithm is presented, leveraging various signal processing and multidisciplinary feature engineering techniques. The approach is thoroughly evaluated through a large set of cross-validation (CV) data, aiming to enhance early detection and contribute to the prevention of stroke and heart failure associated with AFib.
